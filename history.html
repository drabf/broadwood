<b>1718</b>
<p>Burkat Shudi came to London, aged 16, from Switzerland where his family were craftsmen in wood. He became an apprentice in the Soho harpsichord workshop of Hermann Tabel. Tabel had learnt his craft in the Antwerp workshop of the Ruckers family, the greatest harpsichord makers of the 17th century. Tabel is also notable since he took as apprentice two of the greatest harpsichord makers of the 18th century, Jacob Kirkman and Shudi.</p>


<b>1728</b>
<p>Shudi started his own workshop. This was the foundation of the business now known as John Broadwood & Sons.</p>
<b>1729 </b>
<p>Young Shudi (not yet 30) made a harpsichord for Handel, who wanted to give a special present to a soprano starring in his Italian opera season in London.</p>

<b>1740 </b>
<p>Shudi built a harpsichord for Frederick, Prince of Wales (it is now in Kew Palace). Other instruments were made for his father King George II, and Broadwoods have made instruments for every British monarch since. Broadwood have held the Royal Warrant longer than any other warrant holder.</p>
<b>1761 </b>
<p>John Broadwood came to London from his native Scotland to seek his fortune. Aged 29, he was the eldest son of the village "wright" or carpenter of Oldhamstocks in the Lothian hills, south of Edinburgh.</p>
<b>1765</b>
<p>Nine-year-old Mozart, visiting London, played a Shudi harpsichord.</p>
<b>1769</b>
<p>John Broadwood, a fine craftsman, married Barbara, Shudi's younger daughter.</p>
<b>1771 </b>
<p>Shudi handed over the running of his business to his son Burkat and John Broadwood.</p>
<b>1773 </b>
<p>Shudi died, bequeathing the workshop to his son and his son-in-law John Broadwood, who became its effective head.</p>
<b>
THE PIANO </b><br><br>
<b>1700 - 1800 </b>
<p>Meanwhile the 'piano-forte' was being developed to provide more variation of tone and greater volume than the harpsichord could offer.</p>
<p>The first maker to create an instrument with hammers hitting the strings was the Italian, Cristofori, musical instrument maker to the Medici family. He had made three instruments on the style of the 'piano' by 1709.</p>
<p>Pianos were developed across Europe during the 18th century. The earliest ones to come to London were 'square' pianos.
A leading workshop (Silbermann) was in Freiberg, Germany. When this was closed down by the Seven Years War, twelve workmen ("the apostles") came to London. One of them, Johannes Zumpe, worked for Shudi - where he would have known John Broadwood - before starting his own workshop making square pianos. They were advertised in London from 1763, and Bach's son Johann Christian Bach played one in a London concert in 1767.</p>
<p>Meanwhile John Broadwood joined with another Scot, Robert Stodart, and a Dutchman, Americus Backers, to design a piano in the harpsichord case - the origin of the 'grand'. They achieved this in about 1777.</p>

<p>By 1778, when John Broadwood had been in charge of Shudi & Broadwood for five years, he was not only a leading maker of harpsichords, but experimenting with the new, pianoâ€™ also (one of his own make on Zumpe's pattern survives, dated 1774, in working order).</p>

<b>THE COMPANY</b><br><br>
<b>1774</b>
<p>Broadwood supplied harpsichords to the painters Reynolds and Gainsborough, and Josef Haydn in Vienna ordered one. He was also exporting to Russia, Denmark, Portugal, Italy, France, the West Indies, and America (where his agent was John Jacob Astor). </p>
<b>1783</b>
<p>Broadwood patented improvements in the piano, particularly the brass under-damper that made the square much more stable, and the English double action.</p>

<b>1784</b>
<p>By this date, Broadwood was making more pianos than harpsichords. In this year he sold 38 harpsichords, and 133 pianos, having increased production ten times in twelve years.</p>
<b>1785</b>
<p>Thomas Jefferson, later to be third President of the United States, visited Broadwood in Great Putney Street, Soho, to discuss musical instruments.</p>
<b>1788</b>
<p>Broadwood commissioned scientific research (Royal Society and British Museum) on the improvement of the piano. This resulted in the introduction of the 'divided bridge' on the grand, which improved the bass tone.</p>
<b>1789-94</b>
<p>'Additional keys' were added, increasing the keyboard from 5, to 5 1/2, to 6 octaves.</p>
<b>1793</b>
<p>Last Broadwood harpsichords made. Other makers continued (e.g. Kirkman), but went out of business as pianos took the market.</p>
<b>1795</b>
<p>Firm became 'John Broadwood & Son', with the introduction of John Broadwood's elder son James Shudi Broadwood.</p>
<b>1796</b>
<p>A grand made as a present for the Queen of Spain, the case designed by Thomas Sheraton with Wedgwood medallions (now in the Boston Museum of Fine Art).</p>
<b>1798</b><p> Main production, the grand and square. Not yet the upright, although the 'upright grand' was introduced - a grand on its end, over 8 ft high. Important customers included the wives of Nelson and Wellington.</p>
<b>1808</b>
<p>Firm became 'John Broadwood & Sons', with the introduction of John Broadwood's second son, Thomas.</p>
<b>1812</b>
<p>John Broadwood died leaving an immense estate. His sons increased production.</p>
<b>1817 </b>
<p>Thomas Broadwood, touring Europe after the Napoleonic Wars, visited Beethoven in Vienna, and in 1818 sent him a 6 octave grand, triple-stringed (now in the National Museum of Hungary, Budapest). It was later owned by Liszt.</p>
<b>1821 </b><p>Grand piano delivered to King George IV at Brighton Pavilion: rosewood with brass inlay, which was now becoming fashionable.</p>
<b>1820-30</b>
<p>Introduction of metal bars to the grand, and metal stringplate to the square, giving greater power and volume.</p>
<b>1836</b>
<p>Henry Fowler Broadwood (eldest surviving son of James Broadwood) joined the partnership, which he led through the century.</p>
<b>1840 </b>
<p>Queen Victoria married Prince Albert, who bought a Broadwood square for Buckingham Palace, where the young couple made music with Mendelssohn.</p>
<b>1842 </b>
<p>2,500 pianos a year were being made in the great factory in Horseferry Road, Westminster. Broadwoods were one of the twelve largest employers of labour in London, in an industry that was still craft-based with all parts made in-house.

<p>Chopin provided with three Broadwood grands for his British tour - for his London lodging, London concerts, and Scottish concerts.</p>
